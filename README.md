#### Material-icons-sketch-library-with-color-overrides
This is a collection of all material icons from Google. The Sketch file contains icons as symbols with color overrides, so you can easily change their colors. Black and white colors are available by default, but you can add your own ones on the Colors page. All icons are set to exportable directly on the symbols page, so they will be exportable assets in Zeplin if uploaded.
